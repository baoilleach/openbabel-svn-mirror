Several small programs are available as exe files, which
should be run from a DOS command window.
For syntax info, execute them without parameters.

obabel - alternative commandline interface for babel.
It has a more UNIX-like syntax, requiring the output file
to be specified as a -O option, reducing the chances of unwanted
over-writing of files. The handling of options is improved,
allowing more versatile options in the future.

obchiral       - print molecular chirality information
obconformer    - superimpose two molecules based on a SMARTS pattern
obenergy       - calculate the energy for a molecule using a forcefield
obfit          - superimpose a set of molecules on the atoms of a reference molecule
obgrep         - search for molecules inside multi-molecule database files
                 (babel has the same functionality via -s option);
obminimize     - minimize the energy for a molecule
obprobe        - calculate the energy of adding a probe atom
obprop         - print standard molecular properties
obrotamer      - generate a random rotamer for a given molecule
obrotate       - batch-rotate dihedral angles matching SMARTS patterns
obspectrophore - one-dimensional descriptors from Silicos

See http://openbabel.org/wiki/Guides or

for further details of some of the above programs

The following are not implemented in Windows:
obgen       - babel has the same functionality (--gen3D)
obxyz       - uses the unavailable getopt function
obfragment  - is not routinely used
obdoc       - is not routinely used
obmm        - openbabel molecular mechanics program
obseq       - residue sequence information for biomolecules
obsym       - 3D Point Group Symmetry
