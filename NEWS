Open Babel 2.2.1 (2009-03-01)

What's New from 2.2.0:

This release represents a major bug-fix release and is a stable
upgrade, strongly recommended for all users of Open Babel. While there
may not be many new features, many crashes and other bugs have been
fixed since 2.2.0.

- Improved scripting interfaces, including Python 3 support and improved
  Java and C# support.
- Added support for MACCS fingerprints. Thanks to the RDKit project.
- Many fixes and enhancements to the force field code. In particular,
  the UFF force field implementation should handle many more molecules.
- Improved 3D coordinate generation, particularly with ring
  fragments. You can give this a try with the obgen utility.
- Fixed a variety of PDB import errors with atom types.
- Added support for reading charges and radii from PQR file formats.
- Added support for reading and writing unit cells in PDB formats.
- New "output" file format for taking generic ".out", ".log", and
  ".dat" files and reading with appropriate file type based on
  contents. Currently works extremely well for quantum chemistry
  packages.
- Added improved error handling and reporting when unable to load file
  formats.
- Improved CIF file format support.
- Many, many, many additional bug fixes and small enhancements.


Open Babel 2.2.0 (2008-07-04)

What's New from 2.1.1:

- New support for 3D coordinate generation using the OBBuilder class.
    Note that this code directly supports non-chiral compounds
    Stereochemistry may or may not be supported in this release

    for constrained optimization.
- New force fields, including complete UFF, MMFF94, and MMFF94s implementations.

   Initial descriptors include hydrogen-bond donors, acceptors,
    octanol/water partition, topological polar surface area, molar
    refractivity, molecular weight, InChI, SMARTS, titles, Lipinski
    Rule of Five, etc.

    conversion process as plugin code.
   Initial operations include 3D coordinate generation, tautomer
    standarization, and addition of polar hydrogens. 
- Code for integrating Open Babel and the BOOST graph library.
- Improved scripting support, including new bindings for C# and
    improved Java, Ruby, Python, and Perl bindings.
- Space group support and thoroughly revised and improved CIF format.
- Initial support for 3D point group symmetry perception.
- Improved support for "grids" or "cubes" of molecular data, such as
    from quantum mechanics programs. (See below for supported file
    formats.)
- Initial support for reading trajectories and animations.
- Improved support for reaction formats, including CML, RXN, and
    Reaction SMILES.
- Improved residue handling in PDB and Mol2 formats.

    implemented for MDL formats.
- Many more bug fixes and small feature improvements.

   formats from the command-line, including: GAMESS, Gaussian, Q-Chem, and
   MOPAC. (This feature can also be accessed by developers and
   expanded to other formats.)

Open Babel 2.0 (2005-11-26)

What's New from 1.100.2:

This release represents Open Babel's fourth "birthday" and a milestone for
a stable, flexible interface for developers and users alike.

- New conversion framework. The new framework allows dynamic
   loading/unloading of file translator modules (i.e., shared
   libraries, DLLs, DSO, etc.). More importantly, it facilitates adding
   new formats, since each format is self-contained and no editing of
   other files is required.
- Improved support for XML chemistry formats, including CML, PubChem XML, 
- Support for fingerprinting and calculation of Tanimoto coefficients for 
   similarity consideration. 
   (A flexible fingerprint framework is available for developers.)
- New support for Perl and Python "wrappers" of the Open Babel library.
- Many enhancements to the Open Babel API: See the Developers API Notes for
   more information. Some code will require updating, see the 
   Developer's Migration Guide for details.
- Support for automatically reading .gz compressed files.
   (e.g., 1abc.pdb.gz is uncompressed and treated as a PDB file)
   Use of the -z flag creates gzip-compressed output files.
- Support for the new IUPAC InChI identifiers.
- Improved bond order typing, including flexible SMARTS matching in
   bondtyp.txt.
- New Kekulization routine -- improves aromaticity detection in aromatic amines
   like pyrroles, porphyrins, etc.
- Improved support for radicals and spin multiplicity, including
   assignment of hydrogens to radicals.
- Improved support for 2D vs. 3D file formats.
- New error logging framework keeps an "audit log" of changes to files
   (hydrogen addition, bond order assignment) and different levels of
   error reporting / debugging.
   Use the "---errorlevel 4" flag to access this information.
- Improved atom typing and hydrogen addition rules.
- Improved obfit utility will output RMSD and find matches with the
   best RMSD.
- Updated isotope data from 2003 IUPAC standard.
- Updated elemental data from the Blue Obelisk Data Repository.
   (project started, in part, to validate the old Open Babel data)
- Improved z-matrix code (CartesianToInternal / InternalToCartesian).
- Countless bug fixes.

Open Babel 1.100.2 (2004-02-22)

What's New from 1.100.1:

 -Shared library (version 0:0:0) built by default on POSIX systems
  (e.g. Linux, BSD, Mac OS X...)
 -Fixed installation of header files. The headers in the math/
  subdirectory were not installed alongside the other headers.
 -Added tools/ directory with small examples of using libopenbabel:
   * obgrep: Use SMARTS patterns to grep through multi-molecule files.
   * obfit:  Use SMARTS patterns to align molecules on substructures.
   * obrotate: Rotate a torsional bond matching a SMARTS pattern.
 -Improved PDB support: uses HETATM records more appropriately, attempts to
  determine chain/residue information if not available.
 -Fixed a variety of bugs in ShelX support.
 -Added support for handling atom and molecule spin multiplicity.
 -Updated documentation -- not yet complete, but significantly improved.
 -Fixed major omissions in CML readers and writers. All versions of CML are now
  supported (CML1/2 and array/nonArray). Also added *.bat
  file for roundtripping between these formats for both 2- and 3-D data.

Open Babel 1.100.1 (2003-6-24)

What's New from 1.100.0:

 -Much better bond typing overall for files converted from formats
  without bond information (e.g. XYZ, QM codes). Fixed some bugs in
  1.100.1 and added additional improvments.
 -Support for the command-line "babel" program to convert some or
  all structures in a file with multiple molecules. By default this
  version will convert all molecules in a file. To change this, use
  the -f and -l command-line options as documented in the man page.
 -Isotope support, including exact masses in the "report" file
  format and SMILES data.
 -Updated API documentation.
 -Support for the Borland C++ compiler.
 -Fixed a variety of bugs in the PDB file format support, including
  better bond typing.
 -Support for output of residue information in the Sybyl Mol2 file
  format.
 -Some support for conversion of unit cell information, both in the
  library and in some file formats (i.e. DMol3, Cacao).
 -Coordinates now use double-precision floating point libraries for
  greater accuracy in conversions.
 -Fixed a variety of bugs uncovered in roundtrip testing.
 -Fixed a bug when attempting to perceive bond information on 2D
  structures.
 -Fixed several rare bugs that could cause segmentation faults.

New File Formats:

Open Babel 1.100.0 (2002-12-12)

What's New from 1.99:

  bonds (quantum chemistry programs, XYZ, etc.).  -Now better conforms to the ISO
  C++ standard, should compile on most modern C++ compilers.
 -Improved test suite, including "roundtrip" testing, ensuring more accurate translations.
 -Support for the Chemical Markup Language (CML) and other file formats. (see below)
 -Improved PDB support -- should read PDB files more accurately and hew closer to the current PDB standard for export.
