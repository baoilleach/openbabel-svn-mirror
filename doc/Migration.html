<h1>OELib -&gt; Open Babel Migration Guide</h1>

<h2>by Geoff Hutchison (January 2002)</h2>

<p>At the moment, Open Babel as a separate project is just getting off
the ground. It is still largely based on the original GPL'ed OELib and
even the current <a href="Primer.shtml">Primer</a> bundled with Open Babel is actually Matt Stahl's draft for documentation on OELib.</p>

<p>Recognizing this and that some people will be migrating code from the
GPL'ed OELib which is no longer maintained to Open Babel, this is a
short migration guide. Since OpenEye is developing OELib in a
different direction, this guide will eventually become obsolete. By
that point, hopefully, more complete documentation to Open Babel will
exist as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are several obvious changes in Open Babel. Foremost, to prevent
clashes with the OELib API, Open Babel uses the namespace
OpenBabel. Additionally, all calls to OEFoo have become OBFoo,
e.g. OEMol -&gt; OBMol, OEAtom -&gt; OBAtom, etc. This also includes source
files, so oeutil -&gt; obutil, oeifstream.h -&gt; obifstream.h, etc.</p>

<p>In order to conform to ISO C++ and compile successfully on gcc-3.0 and
later, several changes were necessary to the nasty casting implemented
in OELib. In particular, OELib often casts between vectors and
iterators, which is a decided problem. Therefore all iterators over
vectors of OEBond or OEAtom are implemented as the base classes:
OBEdgeBase for bonds and OBNodeBase for atoms.</p>

<p>So code like:</p>
<pre>
  vector&lt;OEBond*&gt;::iterator j;

  for (bond = mol.BeginBond(j); bond; bond = mol.NextBond(j))
</pre>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre>
  vector&lt;OBEdgeBase*&gt;::iterator j;

  for (bond = mol.BeginBond(j); bond; bond = mol.NextBond(j))
</pre>

<p>Finally, for maintainability purposes, the convenience &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;
operators to read in or write out an OBMol have been removed. Use the
OBFileFormat class to do this since this code is ensured to be updated
for new file types.</p>

<p>The build environment is slightly different, though at the moment this
should present little migration difficulties. In particular, Open
Babel uses GNU autoconf instead of a custom configure shell script.</p>

<p>Additionally, the global data tables like etab, extab, etc. all
default to a slightly different priority to find the associated data
files. First it will check the BABEL_DATADIR environment variable if
set, then it will check a compiled-in directory path set by the
configure script, which defaults to {prefix}/share/openbabel. Failing
that, Open Babel will resort to the compiled in binary data rather
than reading in a text file. As with OELib, both the environment
variable and the directory to search may be modified by the calling code.</p>
