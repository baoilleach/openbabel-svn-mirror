Open Babel for Java (JNI) 0.5
--------------------

This directory contains a set of SWIG-generated interface classes for
using the Open Babel C++ library from Java. It is currently
experimental and has not been thoroughly tested.

To compile, run the following steps:

% javac *.java
# assuming that jni.h is found in /usr/include/java
% g++ -c -fpic openbabel_java.cpp -I../../include -I/usr/include/java
# assuming that libopenbabel.so is in /usr/local/lib
% g++ -shared -lopenbabel -L/usr/local/lib openbabel_java.o libopenbabel.so 

(This README needs a bit of work... hopefully some experimentation
will automate this process and give some simple java examples.
