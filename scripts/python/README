OpenBabel Python bindings version 1.6
=====================================

This is a Python interface to the Open Babel chemistry library. 

Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages
of chemical data. It's an open, collaborative project allowing anyone
to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling,
chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas.

The wrapper is generated using the SWIG package and provides access to
almost all of the Open Babel interfaces via Python, including the base
classes OBMol, OBAtom, OBBond, and OBResidue, as well as the
conversion framework OBConversion.
