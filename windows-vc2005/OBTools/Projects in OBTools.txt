The OBTools solution builds several command-line programs
as exe files.For syntax info execute them without parameters.

nbabel - alternative commandline interface for babel.
It has a more UNIX-like syntax, requiring the output file
to be specified as a -O option. This has the side -effect of
simplifying the handling of options in the code, and could be
the favored direction for the future.

obchiral    - print molecular chirality information
obconformer - superimpose two molecules based on a SMARTS pattern
obenergy    - calculate the energy for a molecule using a forcefield
obfit       - superimpose a set of molecules on the atoms of a reference molecule
obminimize  - minimize the energy for a molecule
obmm        - openbabel molecular mechanics program
obprobe     - calculate the energy of adding a probe atom
obprop      - print standard molecular properties
obrotamer - generate a random rotamer for a given molecule
obrotate    - batch-rotate dihedral angles matching SMARTS patterns
obseq       - residue sequence information for biomolecules
obsym       - 3D Point Group Symmetry

for further details of some of the above programs

The following are not implemented in Windows:
obgrep     - babel has the same functionality;
           - uses the unavailable getopt function
obgen      - babel has the same functionality (--gen3D)
obxyz      - uses the unavailable getopt function
obfragment - is not routinely used
obdoc      - is not routinely used
