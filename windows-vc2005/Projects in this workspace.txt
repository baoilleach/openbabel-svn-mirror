The projects in this workspace are intended for Visual Studio 2005 (VC8).
The various builds all use the same cross-platform source code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL builds

OpenBabelDLL
This makes OpenBabelDLL.dll (or the debug version OpenBabelDLLD.dll) 
which contains all of Openbabel except the user interface. This DLL 
could be used to access OB's chemical core classes (#include mol.h 
and #include obconversion.h) in the calling program, or just the 
conversion capabilities, when only obconversion.h needs to be included.

OBComLn
This makes a babel.exe which has the command line interface and calls
OpenBabelDLL.dll.

OBGUII
This makes OBGUII.exe which has the wxWidgets GUI interface and calls 
OpenBabelDLL.dll. wxWidgets needs to have been installed.

On VC8 Release builds the babel.exe, OBGUII.exe, OpenBabelDLL.dll and 
OpenBabel.lib are put in the OpenBabelDLL folder. In Debug 
builds they are in the OpenBabelDLL\debug subfolder. 
LIBINCHI.DLL, LIBXML2.DLL, ICONV.DLL, and ZLIB1.DLL also need to be 
in the executable folder or on the path specified by the PATH 
environment variable. 

OBPython
This uses SWIG to generate an interface so that OpenBabel can be used.
from Python.

When using VC8, in addition to various macros defined in the project 
files it is necessary to define the following to avoid a large number 
of warnings. 
_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE
_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE
_CRT_SECURE_CPP_OVERLOAD_STANDARD_NAMES
