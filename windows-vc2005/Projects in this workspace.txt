The projects in this workspace are intended for Visual Studio 2005 (VC8).
The various builds all use the same cross-platform source code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single DLL build    openbabel.sln

OpenBabelDLL
This makes OpenBabelDLL.dll (or the debug version OpenBabelDLLD.dll) 
which contains all of Openbabel except the user interface. This DLL 
could be used to access OB's chemical core classes (#include mol.h 
and #include obconversion.h) in the calling program, or just the 
conversion capabilities, when only obconversion.h needs to be included.

OBComLn
This makes a babel.exe which has the command line interface and calls
OpenBabelDLL.dll.

OBGUII
This makes OBGUII.exe which has the wxWidgets GUI interface and calls 
OpenBabelDLL.dll. wxWidgets needs to have been installed.

On VC8 Release builds the babel.exe, OBGUII.exe, OpenBabelDLL.dll and 
OpenBabel.lib are put in the OpenBabelDLL folder. In Debug 
builds they are in the OpenBabelDLL\debug subfolder. 
LIBINCHI.DLL, LIBXML2.DLL, ICONV.DLL, and ZLIB1.DLL also need to be 
in the executable folder or on the path specified by the PATH 
environment variable. 

OBPython
This uses SWIG to generate an interface so that OpenBabel can be used.
from Python.

Multiple DLL build    openbabelOBF.sln

This build produces several DLLs and obf files. The latter are also DLLs
but are loaded when the program starts. The latter provides a method to
add additional formats and other plugin features without recompiling the
program.

OBDLL    API, Chemical core
OBConv   File conversion
OBError  Error handling, plugins, etc.
OBDESC   Descriptos
OBFPRT   Fingerprints, forcefields

OBCommonFormats smiles, mdl, mol2, pdb formats
OBMoreFormats   most of the formats
OBXMLFormats    CML, PubChem, reaction formats
OBInchi         InChI format
OBMCDL          MCDL format
OBUtilFormats   molreport, png, povray formats, etc.
FastSearch      fastsearch, fingerprint formats
gen3D           gen3D op

OBConsole  Command-line iterface
OBGUI      GUI interface

OBPythonOBF     Uses SWIG to generate Python interface.
