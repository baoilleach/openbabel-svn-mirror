   * @since version 2.3
   * @class OBIsomorphismMapper
   * @brief Abstract class defining interface for isomorphism (i.e. substructure) searches.
   *
   * The OBIsomorphism class is an abstract class which defines an interface for
   * performing isomorphism (i.e. substructure) searches. It uses a OBQuery and
   * tries to map this onto a queried OBMol. A single mapping is represented by
   * a OBIsomorphismMapper::Mapping which is a std::map mapping query indexes to
   * queried indexes. Both query and queried indexes in the map start from 0.
   * Multiple mappings can be stored in a OBIsomorphismMapper::Mappings object
   * which is a std::vector of OBIsomorphismMapper objects.
   *
   * Since this is an abstract class with pure virtual methods, this class can't
   * be instantiated directly. To get a pointer to a subclass, the GetInstance()
   * method can be used which also sets the query. Once an instance is obtained,
   * the desired mapping function can be used to perform the mapping (i.e. MapFirst(),
   * MapUnique() or MapAll()).
   *
   * A typical example:
   * @code
   * OBMol *queried;
   * // ... initialize queried ...
   * OBQuery *query = CompileSmilesQuery("c1ccccc1");
   * OBIsomorphismMapper *mapper = OBIsomorphismMapper::GetInstance(query);
   * OBIsomorphismMapper::Mappings maps = mapper->MapUnique(mol);
   *
   * std::cout << "found " << maps.size() << " unique mappings" << std::endl;
   *
   * delete mapper;
   * delete query;
   * @endcode
   *
   * All mapping methods take an optional mask parameter. This can be used to
   * restrict the search to a part of the queried OBMol. The masked atoms in
   * the OBBitVec are  indexed from 1. A special case of isomorphism search is
   * an automorphism search where the query and queried molecule are the same.
   * Automorphism searches can be done using the MapAll method but an additional
   * FindAutomorphisms() function is provided for convenience.

  /**
   * @page substructure Substructure Search
   *
   * Substructure searching is finding a mapping for a query to a target molecule.
   * Such a mapping is also known as a graph isomorphism. A graph isomorphism maps
   * the vertexes (i.e. atoms) from the query to vertexes in the molecule such that
   * two vertexes adjacent in the query are also adjacent in the target molecule.
   * In other words, no bonds are broken and no new bonds are formed.
   *
   * @section smarts SMARTS Substructure Search
   * Smarts is an extension of smiles to create powerful queries. Smarts substructure
   * search has been available in OpenBabel for many years. It is also used for many
   * of OpenBabel's algorithms. Although smarts is only a syntax for queries, the
   * implementation has it's own matching algorithm. For many purposes smarts are the
   * easiest way to do substructure searches. See the OBSmartsPattern documentation
   * for details on how to use smarts.
   *
   * @section query Queries
   * Since OpenBabel version 2.3, there are some classes for representing generic
   * queries. The OBQuery, OBQueryAtom and OBQueryBond class define interfaces that
   * can be reimplemented to get custom behavior. The classes also contain some
   * methods to access topological information which are used by the mapping
   * algorithms. The default implementations allow very simple exact substructure
   * searches to be performed but subclassing allows very advanced queries to be
   * used (e.g. smarts).
   *
   * While it is possible to construct these queries manually, "compilers" are
   * provided to convert a query representation to a OBQuery object. Currently,
   * only two exact substructure search compilers exist. The first is
   * CompileMoleculeQuery which converts an OBMol object to an OBQuery object.
   * The second is CompileSmilesQuery and converts a smiles string to an OBQuery
   * object.
   *
   * @code
   * OBMol *mol = new OBMol;
   *
   * // ... read molecule ...
   *
   * OBQuery *query;
   * query = CompileMoleculeQuery(mol);
   * query = CompileSmilesQuery("c1ccccc1CC(=O)O");
   * @endcode
   *
   * @section mapping Mapping Isomorphisms
   * The OBIsomorphismMapper class defined an interface for mapping queries to
   * target molecules. Multiple implementations can be added but they all do the
   * same. The MapFirst, MapUnique and MapAll methods are used for gettings the
   * map(s).
   *
   * @subsection MapFirst
   * This method returns the first map found. The main reason for getting only
   * one map is improved performance since it is considerably faster than
   * MapUnique and MapAll. However, depending on the use case a single map is
   * all that is needed. For example, to check if a molecule in a database
   * contains a phenyl ring, a single mapping is enough.
   *
   * @subsection MapUnique
   * MapUnique returns all unique maps. A map is considered unique if there is
   * no other map covering exactly the same atoms in the target molecule. For
   * example, when a phenyl query is performed on a molecule with 2 phenyl rings,
   * MapUnique will return 2 maps. These 2 maps are selected from the 24 found
   * non-duplicate maps (6 atoms to start from * 2 directions (CW/CCW) * 2 rings).
   *
   * @subsection MapAll
   * MapAll returns all non-duplicate maps. For example, when a phenyl query is
   * performed on a molecule with 2 phenyl rings, MapAll will return 24 maps
   * (6 atoms to start from * 2 directions (CW/CCW) * 2 rings).
   *
   * @section automorphisms Automorphisms
   * The automorphisms of a graph or molecule are a group of isomorphism mappings
   * of the molecule onto itself (i.e. the query and target are the same). The
   * automorphisms make it easy to take symmetry into account. See FindAutomorphisms
   * for detials.
