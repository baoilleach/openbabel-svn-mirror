Open Babel AUTHORS
-------------------

Open Babel would not be what it is without the help of a cast of many.
We are fundamentally a community project and aim to offer open 
development, responsive to users and contributors alike.

The Open Babel project is currently loosely managed by:
Michael Banck
Geoff Hutchison
Chris Morley
