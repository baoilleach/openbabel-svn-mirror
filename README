Open Babel README version 2.1
----------------

Open Babel is a free, open-source version of the Babel 
chemistry file translation program. OpenBabel is a project designed to
pick up where Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library
designed to interconvert between many file formats used in molecular
modeling and computational chemistry.

Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a
C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a
replacement for the original babel program, to translate between
various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the
file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to
foster development of other open source chemistry software.
