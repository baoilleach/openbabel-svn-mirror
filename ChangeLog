2002-03-27  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/cml.cpp: Fix use of strcmp() in code in favor of strncmp()
	to prevent buffer overflow. Fixes problems with 2D/3D export.
	
2002-03-26  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/cml.cpp: New CML support, including built-in XML parser,
	contributed by Peter Murray-Rust.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add cml.cpp to list to support CML compilation.

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add CML file type.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Update to add in .cml files.

	* src.fileformat.cpp, src/fileformat.h: Add in support for CML
	read/write as well as passing options to WriteMolecule methods.

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for passing output options (currently
	only XML/CML) to export methods.
	
	* src/aromatic.txt: Enable support for recognizing Se in aromatic
	rings. (Uncommon, but I've been doing work with selenophene
	recently.)

	* src/pdb.cpp (ParseConectRecord): Fix bugs in CONECT records with
	PDB files. Would only read first 4 columns and wouldn't handle
	multiple bonds. Fixes PR #529744. Use PerceiveBondOrders() when
	using ConnectTheDots() for missing bonds.
	
	* src/ghemical.cpp: Add error checking for reading bonds. Don't
	assume the # of bonds given in the header is correct.

	* src/mol.cpp: Check to see if a bond exists before adding
	it. (Prevents a bond addition (a,b) followed by (b,a).)

2002-02-22  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/Makefile.in: Add viewmol.o.

	* src/viewmol.cpp: New code to read/write ViewMol files as ported
	from the GPL'ed patch sent by J?rg-R?diger Hill.

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp, src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Add
	ViewMol format and enable Chem3D and derived formats.

	* src/c3d.cpp: Clean up Read methods to match normal declarations.

	* src/fileformat.h, src/fileformat.cpp: Enable Read/Write for
	Chem3d1, Chem3d2, Mmads and ViewMol formats.

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for using '--' to read from STDIN and
	output to STDOUT. Tackles request #519085.
	
2002-02-17  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* README, configure.in, configure: Update for next snapshot of
	1.99.1.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add -I(builddir) to ensure that
	configure-generated version.h is included.

	* src/alchemy.cpp, src/amber.cpp, src/balst.cpp, src/box.cpp,
	src/cacao.cpp, src/car.cpp, src/ccc.cpp, src/dmol.cpp,
	src/feat.cpp, src/gamess.cpp, src/gaussian.cpp, src/hin.cpp,
	src/jaguar.cpp, src/mopac.cpp, src/mpqc.cpp, src/nwchem.cpp,
	src/qchem.cpp, src/report.cpp, src/unichem.cpp, src/xyz.cpp:
	Make sure that SetTitle() is called with the default title if the
	format doesn't have a title, do not set atom types unless the
	format supports them (the internal atom typer is better), and for
	formats without bond information, call the new
	mol.PerceiveBondOrders() method.

	* src/mol.h, src/mol.cpp: Rename PerceiveBonds in favor of
	more accurate PerceiveBondOrders(). Make sure that
	auto-hybridization is turned off while bond orders are being
	perceived and then let it run afterwards.
	
2002-02-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBonds): Improve accuracy by picking the
	closer atom (shorter bond) when there are two atoms with equal
	electronegativities.

	* src/main.cpp: Add -v flag to give version information but not
	the whole usage report.
	
	* src/base.h, src/binary_io.h, src/bitvec.h, src/commandline.h,
	src/ctransform.h, src/data.h, src/fileformat.h, src/grid.h,
	src/matrix.h, src/mol.h, src/obutil.h, src/smarts.h: Remove
	"using" statements from header files which pollute namespace of
	user code. Fixes PR#493388.

2002-02-14  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add MIME support to
	OBExtensionTable. Progress towards feature request #511533.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: As above (using as much from the
	current Chemical MIME page as possible).

	* src/mol.h, src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBonds): Add preliminary support
	for assigning bond orders based on Roger Sayle's "Cruft to
	Content" algorithm. Still needs functional group and aromatic ring
	recognition passes. Progress towards feature request #514589.
	<http://www.daylight.com/meetings/mug01/Sayle/m4xbondage.html>

	* src/mopac.cc: Fix bugs in read/write methods as pointed out by
	Radek Liboska. Should solve PR #515884.

	* src/atom.cpp (GetType): Fix bug with atom typing by assigning
	the ATN type of an atom if the atom typer didn't pick one before.

	* src/gamess.cpp, src/xyz.cpp, src/unichem.cpp, src/ghemical.cpp:
	Don't try to translate atom types as this causes problems. (Works
	cleanly now that the GetType() bug is fixed.)
	
2002-02-13  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/data.cpp, src/data.h, src/element.txt: Added support for
	electronegativity of elements. (Needed for assigning bond types,
	among other things.)

	* src/element.h: Regenerate using bin2hex.pl.

	* src/ghemical.cpp: Don't try to type atoms, it only causes
	problems with the internal atom typing.

2002-02-07  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>
	
	* src/Makefile.in: Add c3d.cpp to the compilation list.

	* src/obutil.cpp: Migrate quat.c code here temporarily.
	
	* src/mol.cpp, src/mol.h: Resolve problems with declarations of
	old quat.c code since they now fall under OpenBabel namespace.

2002-02-01  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* test/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Delete Makefile when calling
	distclean target.

	* Makefile.in: Fix install target to create the $(mandir) directory.

2002-02-01  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Added manpage to install target.

	* configure, configure.in, Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	src/version.h.in: Put version information in configure.in and made
	generated tarballs contain it.
	
2002-01-24  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* doc/FAQ, doc/babel.1: Minor documentation fixes.
	
2002-01-21  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Fix problems with the dist target.

	* configure, configure.in: Add 'top_builddir' macro to know where
	objdir is in the case that we're not building in the source
	directory.

	* src/Makefile.in: Run the library through 'ranlib', which fixes
	problems on Mac OS X. Fix problems running 'install' when not
	building in the source directory.

	* src/unichem.cpp: Fix bug in reading files.

	* src/version.h: Set version to 1.99.
	
	* test/Makefile.in: Fix problems with the check target: tests need
	to be copied to the build dir if we're not in the source directory.
	
2002-01-21  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* doc/*: Move documentation to subdirectory--since there will
	eventually be more than these few morsels.

	* doc/Migration: Add a Migration guide for OELib -> Open Babel changes.

2002-01-20  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* FAQ, README: Added FAQ.

2002-01-20  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>	

	* babel.1: Initial import of man page, this is only a rough
	draft. Should become babel.1.in perhaps, with the available file
	types determined during the build.

2002-01-18  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>	

        * Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Fixed install target. Removed
	Primer.html, bin2hex.pl and GNULICENSE from datafiles. Added
	datafiles to install: target.

        * Makefile.in, src/data.cpp, src/Makefile.in, src/patty.cpp,
	src/pdb.cpp, src/phmodel.cpp, src/rotor.cpp, src/typer.cpp:
        Openbabel now first checks for $BABEL_DATADIR, then looks in
	${pkgdatadir} and finally uses the compiled-in values to get the
	relevant data.
	
2002-01-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/main.cpp: Use the filename as the default filename when
	reading molecules.

	* src/qchem.cpp: Disable reading final z-matrix--currently
	produces very bizzare results for some files.

	* test/Makefile.in: Make sure the main program is compiled too.

	* test/main.cpp, test/ringtest.cpp, test/smartstest.cpp: Update to
	new OpenBabel API. (Took about a minute to change OE->OB and
	change to iterate over OBNodeBase and OBEdgeBase.)

	* test/smartstest.txt: Get rid of DOS line endings--lines are not
	properly read.

2002-01-11  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/Makefile.in, test/Makefile.in, Makefile.in: Added
	distclean-targets to src and test's Makefiles and removed stamp.h
	again (D'OH).

	* Makefile.in: Added 'stamp.h' to distclean:-target and renamed
	DISTDIR from *openbabel to *openbabel-dist.  ('make dist' fried my
	CVS-repository because it was named 'openbabel') dist:-target
	still does not work properly.
	Removed "\" at the end of first line of distclean:-target

2002-01-09  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* */*: Updated build environment with src/ directory and autoconf
	configure script. Builds cleanly--haven't tried using the "install
	target" The test/ subdir needs fixing to remove OELib references.

2001-12-14  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Changed oeutil.* to the new name obutil.*.

2001-12-14  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* */*: Changed OE prefix to OB -- think I got all the cases, but
	some may crop up.

	Thanks to Michael Banck:
	-Added some GNUish files like AUTHORS, etc.
	-Added configure.in -- will shortly replace configure script with
	an autoconf one. 
	-Need to decide how to work ChangeLog--should it go before
	OELib->OpenBabel change?

	* */*: Many changes to namespace and cleanup of API to work with
	gcc v. 3. Still need to do big OE prefix cleanup.

2001-11-28  ghutchis  <ghutchis@hydra.chem.northwestern.edu>

	* configure, data.cpp, dmol.cpp, main.cpp, mol.cpp, Primer.html,
	Makefile.in: Fixes from Ghemical and a first start at the "Open
	Babel" nomenclature.

2001-11-27  ghutchis  <ghutchis@hydra.chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Import from OE current CVS. (Last GPL'ed version.)
