	* src/main.cpp: Use the filename as the default filename when
	reading molecules.

	* src/qchem.cpp: Disable reading final z-matrix--currently
	produces very bizzare results for some files.

	* test/Makefile.in: Make sure the main program is compiled too.

	* test/main.cpp, test/ringtest.cpp, test/smartstest.cpp: Update to
	new OpenBabel API. (Took about a minute to change OE->OB and
	change to iterate over OBNodeBase and OBEdgeBase.)

	* test/smartstest.txt: Get rid of DOS line endings--lines are not
	properly read.

2002-01-11  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/Makefile.in, test/Makefile.in, Makefile.in: Added
	distclean-targets to src and test's Makefiles and removed stamp.h
	again (D'OH).

	* Makefile.in: Added 'stamp.h' to distclean:-target and renamed
	DISTDIR from *openbabel to *openbabel-dist.  ('make dist' fried my
	CVS-repository because it was named 'openbabel') dist:-target
	still does not work properly.
	Removed "\" at the end of first line of distclean:-target

	* */*: Updated build environment with src/ directory and autoconf
	configure script. Builds cleanly--haven't tried using the "install
	target" The test/ subdir needs fixing to remove OELib references.

2001-12-14  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Changed oeutil.* to the new name obutil.*.

2001-12-14  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* */*: Changed OE prefix to OB -- think I got all the cases, but
	some may crop up.

	Thanks to Michael Banck:
	-Added some GNUish files like AUTHORS, etc.
	-Added configure.in -- will shortly replace configure script with
	an autoconf one. 
	-Need to decide how to work ChangeLog--should it go before
	OELib->OpenBabel change?

	* */*: Many changes to namespace and cleanup of API to work with
	gcc v. 3. Still need to do big OE prefix cleanup.

2001-11-28  ghutchis  <ghutchis@hydra.chem.northwestern.edu>

	* configure, data.cpp, dmol.cpp, main.cpp, mol.cpp, Primer.html,
	Makefile.in: Fixes from Ghemical and a first start at the "Open
	Babel" nomenclature.

	* Import from OE current CVS. (Last GPL'ed version.)
