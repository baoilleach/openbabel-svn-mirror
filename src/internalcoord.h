  //! \brief Used to transform from z-matrix to cartesian coordinates.
  /** Used with InternalToCartesian() and CartensianToInternal() methods.
      Does not perform any actions itself. You must create or free OBAtom
      pointers yourself.

      The z-matrix representation uses coordinates relative to up to three
      atoms, which need not be bonded in any fashion. A rough sketch of the
      a, b, and c atoms would be:
      \code
          *
         /
        /
       a----b
           /
          /
         c
      \endcode
      where the OBInternalCoord record reflects the '*' atom.

      Warning: Does not detect if NULL pointers are used. You should be careful.
