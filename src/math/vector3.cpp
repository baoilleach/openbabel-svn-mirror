  /*! \class vector3
     \brief Represents a vector in the 3-dimensional real space.

The vector3 class was designed to simplify operations with doubleing
point coordinates. To this end many of the common operations have been
overloaded for simplicity. Vector addition, subtraction, scalar
multiplication, dot product, cross product, magnitude and a number of
other utility functions are built in to the vector class. For a full
description of the class member functions please consult the header
file vector3.h. The following code demonstrates several of the
functions of the vector class:
\code
vector3 v1,v2,v3;
v1 = VX;
v2 = VY;
v3 = cross(v1,v2);
v3 *= 2.5;
v3.normalize();
\endcode
  */

     /*! This (slow) method allows to access the elements of the
       vector as if it were an array of doubles. If the index is > 2,
       then a warning is printed, and the program is terminated via
       exit(-1). Otherwise, if i is 0, 1 or 2, then a reference to x,
       y or z is returned, respectively.
       
       \warning This method is primarily designed to facilitate the
       integration ('Open Babelization') of code that uses arrays of
       doubles rather than the vector class. Due to the error checks
       the method is of course very slow and should therefore be
       avoided in production code.
