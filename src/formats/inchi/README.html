<p><span lang=EN-GB>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
MODIFICATION<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>0.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> This License Agreement
applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed
by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this
License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software
functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software
library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work
based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion
of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form
of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the library.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The
act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).
Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that
uses the Library does. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>1.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> You may copy and
distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>2.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> You may modify your copy
or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>(For example, a function in a library to compute square
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied
function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application
does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can
be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must
be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Library. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume
of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>3.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> You may opt to apply the
terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a
given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible
for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the
code of the Library into a program that is not a library. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>4.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> You may copy and
distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>If distribution of object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>5.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> A program that contains
no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the
Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses
the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;
with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that
uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material
from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this
to be true is not precisely defined by law. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions
(ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing
this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any
executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they
are linked directly with the Library itself. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>6.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> As an exception to the
Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,
and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for
the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy
of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were
used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and,
if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or
source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce
a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not
necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.) </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of
the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying
library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
made with. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that
uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the
materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
Library together in an executable that you distribute. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>7.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> You may place library
facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things: </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This
must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>8.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> You may not copy, modify,
sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>9.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> You are not required to
accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants
you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or
works based on it. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>10.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> Each time you
redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>11.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> If, as a consequence of
a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Library. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that choice. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>12.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> If the distribution
and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents
or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>13.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> The Free Software
Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>14.</b></span><span lang=EN-GB> If you wish to
incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>NO WARRANTY </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>15. </b></span><span lang=EN-GB>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS
LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot;

<p><span lang=EN-GB><b>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License). </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at
least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>&lt;one line to give the library's name and an idea of what
it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>This library is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License,
or (at your option) any later version.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General
Public License for more details.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General
Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
and paper mail. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot;
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: </span></p>
