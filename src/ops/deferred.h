/**
DeferredFormat class is intended to assist writing ops that influence the
conversion of multiple molecules with the OBConversion Convert interface.
See, for instance, OpSort. Although it is a format, it does not registered
itself and is used in a different way from normal formats. An op makes an
instance of DeferredFormat, probably when it is first called in its Do()
function.
\code
  if(pConv && pConv->IsFirstInput())
    new DeferredFormat(pConv, this); //it will delete itself
\endcode
Output objects (probably molecules) will then all be diverted to the
DeferredFormat instance and pointers to them stored there. After the last
object, it calls the op's ProcessVec(std::vector<OBBase*>& vec) function.
The objects can be manipulated or deleted (call delete with their pointer).
When the function returns, the remaining molecules in the vector will be
output to the normal output format. No conversion options are applied at
this stage, since they already have been earlier.
