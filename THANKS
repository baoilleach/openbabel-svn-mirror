Open Babel THANKS
-------------------

Open Babel was largely written as OELib and Babel by Matt Stahl and
others. It would not be what it is without the help of a cast of many:

Michael Banck
Francesco Bresciani
Joe Corkery
Vincent Favre-Nicolin
Richard Gillilan
Brian Goldman
Tommi Hassinen
Bryan Herger
Geoffrey Hutchison
Stefan Kebekus
Erik Kruus
Peter Murray-Rust
Anthony Nicholls
Sergei Pachkovsky
Steffen Reith
Roger Sayle
Ajay Shah
Matt Stahl
Bob Tolbert
Pat Walters

There are probably many more who have contributed to Babel, OBabel,
OELib or directly to Open Babel who are not listed here. Please help
us keep this list updated. We'd ideally like to list a short
description of what people contributed. THANKS!
